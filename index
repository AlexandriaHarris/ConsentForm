I want to make a website that allows you to automatically populate a consent form that you can print as a PDF. 

This is based on an existing PDF in our UPMC system and will have a header and a footer.

CONSENT TO SURGERY OR SPECIAL PROCEDURE
I, ___________________________________ have been asked to read all the information contained in this 
 (Name of patient or Designee)
 consent form and to consent to the procedure described below on behalf of ________________________or 
(Name of Patient) 
myself. I have been told that I should ask questions about anything that I do not understand. (If the decisionmaker signing this form is not the patient, references to “I,” “my” or “me” should be read as if referring to “the 
patient.”)
I understand that the information in this consent form, in addition to discussions with my physicians and any 
other written materials they may provide, is intended to help me make an informed decision whether to 
voluntarily undergo the identified procedure. 
Diagnosis: I understand that after being examined, treated, and having studies reviewed, I have been diagnosed 
as having:
Recommended Procedure: I understand that my physician(s) have recommended that I undergo a procedure 
known as 
I understand that a series of the described procedure(s) in the operating room are planned.
Alternatives. I understand that I may choose NOT to undergo the Recommended Treatment. I acknowledge 
that my physician(s) or physician representative has described the alternative treatments, the risks and benefits 
of the alternative treatments, the likelihood of me achieving my goals; any potential problems that might occur 
during recuperation and the likely medical results should I decide not to undergo the recommended procedure. 
These treatment alternatives may include:
Risks of Surgery. I understand that there are inherent risks in the performance of the recommended procedure. 
These include:
1. Bleeding: If needed, blood and/or blood products have the following general risks: reactions resulting
in itching, rash, fever, chills, headache, or shock; respiratory distress (shortness of breath); kidney
damage; systemic bacterial infection; exposure to blood borne viruses including hepatitis (an
inflammatory disease affecting the liver) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS); and death. Alternatives to transfusion include the use of devices that filter and return
blood lost in surgery to me or by providing medications that boost my blood count prior to an elective
procedure. Bleeding and/or severe anemia could put my life in danger or cause permanent brain
damage. I understand that substitutes for blood or plasma might not work well enough. Blood and/or
blood products might offer the only chance to preserve my life.
I refuse the transfusion of blood and/or blood products and understand that I will be asked to sign a separate 
form entitled Release from Liability for the Refusal of Blood Transfusion.
If my procedure is to be performed in an Ambulatory Surgical Facility (ASF), the comparative risks, benefits 
and alternatives associated with performing the procedure in the ASF instead of a hospital have been fully 
explained to me. I understand the hospital may require that all jewelry and/or body piercing hardware be

removed prior to surgery.
2. Infection: This may occur at the site of surgery or elsewhere depending upon procedure
performed.
3. Injury to adjacent organs.
4. Pain. This should resolve within a few days but may be prolonged.
5. As with all surgeries, there is a risk of heart attack, stroke, multisystem organ failure, reactions to
medications, and death, even in healthy patients.
6. Blood clots. These clots usually develop in the legs and can break free and move through the heart to
the lungs. In the lungs, they can cause serious interference with breathing, which can lead to death.
Blood clots are treated with blood-thinning drugs that may need to be taken for an extended period of
time.
7. Nerve damage surrounding the surgical site or Damage to nerves from pressure or positioning of the
arms, legs or back during the surgery. Nerve damage can cause numbness, weakness, paralysis and/or
pain. In most cases these symptoms are temporary, but in rare cases they can last for extended periods
or even permanently.
8. Burns caused by use of electrical equipment that may be needed to stop bleeding or by other equipment.
9. Wound dehiscence.
10. Prolonged hospitalization.
11. Other risks:
Teaching Facility and Overlapping Surgeries: I understand that the facility is a teaching facility. The health 
care team may include residents, fellows, students, and skilled healthcare professionals. Credentialed team 
members may perform all or parts of my procedure under the supervision and guidance of my physician(s). My 
attending physician may also be caring for one other patient during my surgery but remains responsible to me 
and will perform or be present for the key portions of the procedure. If unanticipated circumstances require my 
surgeon to be unavailable during my surgery, another qualified surgeon will promptly come to the operating 
room. Representatives of medical device companies may be present to provide devices and observe and advise 
on their use. Who will participate and in what manner will be decided at the time of the procedure and will 
depend on the availability of individuals with the necessary expertise and on my medical condition. 
If an accidental exposure to my blood or body fluids occurs to staff during the surgery or procedure, I agree to 
blood tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.
I understand that the physician(s) or others may choose to photograph, televise, film, or otherwise record all or 
any portion of my procedure for medical, scientific, or educational purposes. I consent to the photographing, 
televising, filming, or other forms of recording of the procedure(s) to be performed, including appropriate 
portions of my body, body functions or sounds, provided my identity is not revealed. I understand and agree 
that 1) any photographs, films, or other audio or visual recordings created will be the sole property of the 
facility: and 2) the facility or any appropriate staff member may edit, preserve, or destroy all or any part of the

photographs, films, or other audio or visual recordings. Such recordings are not part of the medical record and I 
understand I cannot obtain a copy. 
I authorize the disposal or retention, preservation, testing, or use for scientific, educational, or other purposes of 
all or any portion of specimens, tissues, body parts, or other things, including prostheses and medical/surgical 
appliances, that may be removed from my body.
I understand that if any medical device, as defined by federal regulations, is implanted in a patient’s body, the 
facility is required by law to report to the manufacturer the name, address and social security number of the 
patient and the description and identity of the device.

Awesome — I put a working single-file React app on the canvas that:

    Lets you enter all the fields (patient name/ID/facility, diagnosis, procedure, alternatives, “other risks,” signer/witness/MD/interpreter details).

    Renders a true 4-page, print-ready version of your UPMC consent with the exact language you pasted.

    Repeats the header (Patient Name / Identification Number / Facility / Page X of 4) and footer (*3CNTT* 3CNTT 02/16/2024) on every page.

    Has a Print / Save PDF button that hides the editor and prints on US Letter with proper margins and page breaks.

    Uses Tailwind + shadcn/ui for a clean, clinic-friendly UI and saves entries to localStorage so you don’t lose work on refresh.

If you want tweaks (logo placement, barcode, different footer date code, extra checkboxes like “transfusion refused,” or e-signature lines), tell me and I’ll wire them in.
